# Face Recognition
## Data:
This pins-face-recognition dataset contains 10,770 images for 100 persons. All images took from 'Pinterest' and aligned with dlib library
In this problem, we use a pre-trained model trained on Face recognition to recognize similar faces.
Here, we are particularly interested in recognizing whether two given faces are of the same person or not.
